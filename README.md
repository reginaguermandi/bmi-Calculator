### Built with

- Vue.js
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- methods (when and how)
- v-on:click/@click
- v-model
- data manipulation

### Continued development

- Understand more and be more confortable with Vue.js file structure, as this is my first time with the framework I kinda got lost in the middle of several files. 
- Improve data manipulation, when it is necessary to create a new key/value and where to put it in html.
- Learn about Components and create a bigger project.

### Useful resources

- [Vue.js curse Tiago Matos](https://www.youtube.com/c/tiagomatosweb) - This helped me how to start the project and understand better files structure and learn about some Directives.
